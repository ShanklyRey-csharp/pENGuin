Running pENGuin on it's own will not give you the option to compile your game.
There should be a pENGuin-compiler.exe in your pENGuin install directory.

Drag your .txt onto the compiler file, it will create a folder that you should ship in it's entirely to your users.

Your users do not require an install of pENGuin, to minimise the work required on your consumer's part.

Please note your pENGuin.exe needs to be named as pENGuin.exe and has to be in the same folder as the compiler.
