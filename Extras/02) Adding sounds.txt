To add sounds, the compiler needs to actually recognise they exist.
To do this, create a directory called "sounds" (it has to be all lower case too) in the same directory as your game's file.

Then, drag and drop your .wav files into the new directory (pENGuin only supports .wav, any other files will just not be compiled or playable).

See '01) Keywords' to see how to register and play sounds.
